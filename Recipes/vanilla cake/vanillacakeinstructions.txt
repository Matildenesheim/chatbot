Make the cake
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease and lightly flour 2 round cake pans; set aside.
In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, for about 5 minutes. 
Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. 
Beat in the vanilla.
Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Stir with a whisk and add it to the butter mixture followed by the milk. Beat on medium-low speed just until combined. 
Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. 
Bake for 20-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with few moist crumbs attached. Take care to not over-bake.
Cool for 10 minutes. Remove from pans and cool completely on a wire rack. 
Make the frosting now.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a large mixing bowl with a handheld electric mixer, beat the butter on medium-high speed until creamy and pale in color, about 5 minutes.
Add half the confectioners’ sugar and beat on low speed just until the sugar has fully moistened, then turn the speed up to medium-high and beat until well incorporated, about 3-5 minutes.
Add the remaining confectioners’ sugar and beat on low speed just until the sugar has fully moistened, then turn the speed up to medium-high and beat until well incorporated, about 3-5 minutes.
Add the vanilla and salt. Turn the mixer on low speed and slowly add 3 tablespoons of the heavy cream. Turn the mixer up to medium-high and beat until the cream is well incorporated, about 3-5 minutes.
Check the consistency of the frosting and add more cream, 1/2 tablespoon at a time, if needed. The frosting should be soft and spreadable but not so loose that it doesn’t hold its shape.
Assemble the cake
Place one layer on a serving platter. Spread about 1/3 of the frosting over the top.
Gently place the second layer on top of the frosting. Spread remaining frosting over the top and sides of the cake.

Preheat the oven to 170C. 
Butter and line a round cake tin.
Coat the apple wedges in the lemon juice and set aside.
In a large bowl, beat together the butter and sugar, using an electric hand mixer, until pale and fluffy. 
Add the eggs and beat until smooth. 
Sift in the flour, baking powder and salt and mix well. 
Slowly add the milk, mixing well after each addition, until you have a smooth batter.
Transfer the batter to the cake tin. Arrange the apple slices, flat-side down, on the batter in a spiral pattern.
Bake in the middle of the oven for 40â€“45 minutes. 
Leave to cool for 15 minutes in the tin.
Serve warm or at room temperature with whipped cream.
